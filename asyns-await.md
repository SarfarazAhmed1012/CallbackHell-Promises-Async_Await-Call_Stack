# Asynchronous Programming with `async/await`

This repository provides a comparison between asynchronous programming using Promises and the newer `async/await` syntax. It demonstrates how `async/await` further simplifies handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, offering a more concise and synchronous-looking code structure.

## Promises (Recap)

**Description:**
Promises are a modern feature introduced in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable way. A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and provides a clean syntax for chaining multiple asynchronous tasks.

**Code Example - Using Promises:**

```javascript
function asyncFunction1() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Asynchronous operation...
        if (/* operation successful */) {
            resolve("Result 1");
        } else {
            reject("Error in asyncFunction1");
        }
    });
}

function asyncFunction2(result) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Asynchronous operation...
        if (/* operation successful */) {
            resolve(`${result}, Result 2`);
        } else {
            reject("Error in asyncFunction2");
        }
    });
}

// Chaining Promises to avoid callback hell
asyncFunction1()
    .then(result1 => asyncFunction2(result1))
    .then(finalResult => {
        console.log(finalResult); // Output: "Result 1, Result 2"
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error); // Output: If any operation encounters an error, it will be logged here
    });
```

## `async/await`

**Description:**
`async/await` is a syntactical improvement introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that simplifies working with Promises even further. It allows writing asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.

**Code Example - Using `async/await`:**

```javascript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncFunction1();
    const finalResult = await asyncFunction2(result1);
    console.log(finalResult); // Output: "Result 1, Result 2"
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error); // Output: If any operation encounters an error, it will be logged here
  }
}

// Call the async function
myAsyncFunction();
```

In the above code, we define an `async` function `myAsyncFunction` that uses `await` to pause the execution until the asynchronous functions `asyncFunction1` and `asyncFunction2` complete. The code looks much more synchronous, enhancing readability and reducing the need for `.then` and `.catch` chaining.

## Conclusion

`async/await` is a powerful addition to modern JavaScript, offering a concise and more natural way to handle asynchronous operations. It simplifies the code, making it easier to read and understand, and provides a more synchronous-looking syntax for asynchronous tasks.
